This directory contains the notebooks used for the signal-generator exercises.

Please look in the [exercises](./exercises) directory for template notebooks
that are meant to be completed by the attendee.

The [solutions](./solutions) direcotry contains example solutions for each
exercise.

# Overview
These exercises are meant to serve as an introduction to various magma concepts
from the basic abstractions of circuits and wiring to more advance concepts
that leverage the host language (Python) to implement circuit generators.

A digital signal generator is used to generate stimuli for a digital electronic
device.  They are typically used for testing and debugging digital electronics
and embedded systems as well as stimulating digital signal processing hardware
and digital to analog converters (DACs).

In these exercises, we'll be using saleae logic analyzers to inspect the
patterns we are generating. The software for interfacing with the logic
analyzers can be downloaded at https://www.saleae.com/downloads/.
