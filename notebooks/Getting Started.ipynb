    "[`Magma`](https://github.com/phanrahan/magma) is a simple hardware construction languages written `Python 3`. The central abstraction in `Magma` is a `Circuit`. Magma circuits are analagous to verilog modules. A circuit is a set of functional units that are wired together. Although wiring modules together may seem low-level, it encourages hardware designers to build reusable components, similar to how programmers build libraries. \n",
